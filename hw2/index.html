		<h2>Overview</h2>
		While triangles are a fantastic tool for representing meshes, implemeting smooth curves is vital for creating realistic-looking objects. This homework
		 begins by exploring one specific type of curve: the Bézier curve. These curves allow one to create a degree \(n\) polynomial with only \(n + 1\) control points, and I implement this in 
		 code using de Casteljau's 
		 algorithm. By applying this algorithm multiple times in varying dimensions, I am able to create what's known as a bezier surface, which I can use to visualize this smooth geometry.
		  Later in the assignment I implement Blinn-Phong 
		 lighting, which creates significantly improved surface shading. Finally, I add mesh manipulation tools such as edge flipping, edge splitting, and mesh subdivision.

		 <br><br>

		 All together, this project gave me a foundational understanding for how some meshes are created and represented through code. Most interesting to me was adjusting and creating 
		 my own mesh, as in order to correctly import the file I had to go through and change much of the project's skeleton code. I hope to use this background code as an inspiration for 
		 my final project.
		 

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		Unlike triangles, Bezier curves can be used to generate smooth and rounded edges for surface modeling. A Bezier curve of \( n \) control points is of degree \( n - 1\),
		defined as \( p_1, p_2,...,p_{n} \). Here, de Casteljau's algorithm is implemented to create these curves, which involves a recursive set of steps:

			<li>For each pair of consecutive points \( p_i, p_{i+1},\), linearly interpolate between these points using the formula \( (1-t)p_i + tp_{i+1} \), where \( 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 \). This 
				results in \( n - 1\) points in this intermediate set. 
			</li>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		This section uses de Casteljau's algorithm to generate Bezier surfaces, as seen below. The algorithm is identical to the previous individual Bezier curves; however, these surfaces
		consider curves from two dimensions. Each Bezier patch is a 4x4 surface of 3-dimensional control points, and is constructed by first applying de Casteljau's algorithm to one dimension 
		with parameter \( u \), thus creating 4 sub-curves and eventually 4 interpolated points (one per row). You can then	use de Casteljau's algorithm again with parameter \( v \) 
		on these points, giving you one point \( P\) that lies on the Bezier surface. \( u \) and \( v \) in this case are the interpolation parameters, and can be thought of as coordinates 
		that determine which point on this surface is evaluated.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		Here, I've implemented area-weighted vertex normals to create Phong shading using a mesh represented by the "Half-Edge" structure. To calculate this normal for a given 
		vertex \( v\), we want to compute the normalized sum of the faces incident to \( v\):  
		
		\[ N_v = \frac{\sum_i N_i}{\left\| \sum_i N_i \right\|} \]

		To do this, I calculate the normal for each that is incident to \( v\) by traversing through the Half-Edges. For each face, I take two vectors inside in the face (specifically 
		subtracting the other two vertices from \( v\)), then do the cross product to get the normal vector. After doing this for each face and summing the resulting normals, we then normalize
        to get the normal vector for \( v\).  
		<br><br>

		The difference between flat shading and Phong shading can be seen in the figures below.
		<br><br>

			  </tr>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		The edge flip operation is vital for mesh manipulation and results in the selected edge rotating without creating or destroying new elements. In order to implement this feature,
		I initially created pointers for each vertex, face, and half-edge, then began shuffling them to their correct locations after the flip. I first swapped the half-edges around the 
		edge that is being flipped, then reassigned everything from there. This part took a significant amount
		of time to debug due to one small logical issue, which caused all half-edges to assign their faces incorrectly. This resulted in one face occasionally disappearing after the flip.     

		<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4_before.png" width="400px"/>

				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task4_after.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>After flips</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>

		In this part, I introduced the ability to split an edge, which creates new edges, faces, and half-edges. My technique for the edge split was nearly identical to the previous section, 
		however this time I started with the creation of a diagram that planned out which half-edge, face, or edge would go where relative to the original elements. 
		To start my actual implementation, I began with first instantiating all the iterators of all the new elements to keep track of them. I then defined all the parameters for the 
		half-edges and connected the faces/edges to each half-edge.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		For loop subdivision, I implemented the split and flip method. This involves taking each triangle, splititng it into four by connecting the midpoints, then flipping
		any new edge that connects a new vertex to an old vertex. I began this operation by first computing the new positions for the old vertices, which requires finding the 
		weighted average of the neighboring vertices. After this, I calculated the positions of the new vertices, followed by splitting every edge in the original mesh. Once this
		was done, I could flip the new edges that connected new and old vertices, and then finally move all vertices to their correct positions. 
		<br><br>
		 Here is varying numbers of loop subdivision done on a torus.<br><br>
		
		 
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task6_torus1.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>0 subdivisions</figcaption>

				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>2 subdivisions</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task6_torus4.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>3+ subdivisions + Phong shading</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		<br><br>
			Debugging this part was challenging, as my initial attempt seemed to be be completeley broken. After commenting out my flipping logic, I realized that the mesh was correct 
			up until this point, meaning the flipping was incorrect. In order to resolve this, I added to the GUI so that each edge would show whether it was new. From this, I was able to
			discover that I was incorrectly flipping over edges that were in the original mesh. <br><br>

			Another issue I ran into was that one to two vertices per shape were 'burrowing' into the mesh, and weren't moving like the rest. I decided to add some debugging lines
			that checked whether each vertex and half-edge were pointing to each other, which revealed that I forgot to assign these pointers correctly in the previous tasks.
			
			<br><br>

			In regards to sharp edges, I noticed that they would remain somewhat sharp and pointy regardless of how many times I split. To prevent this,
			I preprocessed these edges by splitting the neighboring edges (highlighted in white and pink in the image below) to prevent the residual sharpness.<br><br>

			<img src="task6_sharp.png" alt="helper1" style="width:300px"/>

				</td>
			  </tr>

		Finally, when subdividing a cube, it becomes slightly asymmetric, as seen in the image below.	

		The main reason for this is the unusual splitting in the default cube, where each side is only made of two triangles. Not only this, but the pattern differs throughout the 
			entire cube. <br><br>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task6_asymbegin.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Initial cube mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="task6_asym.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Resulting subdivided mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>

		In order to fix this, I preprocessed the cube by splitting the edge on each side of the square, making it more normalized. By doing so, the subdivisions are more symmetrical, and it
		results in a significantly better cube. This emphasizes the importance of having normalized and generally equal mesh subdivision patterns. <br><br>

		<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

		<h2>Section III: Potential Extra Credit - Art Competition: Model something Creative</h2>
		For extra credit, I created a full mesh of the UC Berkeley Campanile. This is the mesh I created in blender: <br><br>

		<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="blenderFull.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Original Blender Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Blendercampanile.png" width="650px"/>
				  <figcaption>Original Blender Mesh (Side Shot)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>

			<br><br>
			Here is the mesh exported to my render with a variation of the Blinn-Phong shader: 
			<br><br>
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="campanile1.png" width="440px"/>
				  <figcaption>In Render Mesh</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="Campanile2.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>In Render Mesh (After one subdivision)</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
			<br><br>
			Beyond creating the mesh in Blender, I modified the parameters of the Blinn-Phong shader to give it a more realistic look. Since the Campanile is 
			rough, I adjusted the specular aspect of the light to be a little bit less intense. By doing so, the mesh appears at least slightly more rough. 
			In addition, I also adjusted the background color of the render, so that the background had somewhat of a sky colored blue. The subdivision mainly affected 
			the columns and smaller details of the mesh and slightly rounded the edges of the tower. In addition to this, the holes I created in the sides of the tower became 
			larger, creating rounded dents in the side of the building.
